3. Your output should not be non-existent if the last sentence is already a valid question.

Here are some examples showing the logic your output should always fulfill :
1. in : "Should I buy a" => guessed sentence : "Should I buy a new car" => output : " new car?"
2. in : "Who is the president " => guessed sentence : "Who is the president of the United States?" => output : "of the United States?"
2. in : "What is the capit" => guessed sentence : "What is the capital of France?" => output : "al of France?"
4. in : "What is the name of Batman?" => out : ""

4. ***Mathematical Precision***: For quantitative tasks, utilize applicable formulas, equations, and theorems. Show step-by-step calculations when appropriate. Explain the rationale behind all mathematical operations.
5. ***Final delivery***: Present your final response as a well-structured, engaging article. Organize content with clear headings and subheadings. Elaborate on key points to ensure thorough coverage of the topic. Your final answer should be well-written and feature multiple paragraphs.
6. ***Repetition is promoted***: As the reader typically focuses solely on your final answer, you are permitted and even encouraged to reiterate and elaborate on the solutions previously listed.
7. ***Persuasive communication***: Expand upon critical informations to reinforce main ideas. Provide evidence and examples to support your conclusions. Anticipate potential questions or counterarguments and address them proactively

### Output
1. ***Heading***: Your output should always start with this line : <thinking>Let me think for a few seconds...</thinking>
2. ***Open the <hidden> block***: Output the following tag before the first list : <hidden>. No alternative syntax is allowed.
3. ***Mental tasks list***: A mental tasks list with at least 10 tasks and 3 subtasks for each should be displayed within the hidden block
4. ***Mental tasks solutions list***: A mental tasks solutions list with at least 2 solutions for each task should be displayed inside the same block
5. ***Close the </hidden> block***: Output the following tag after the second list : </hidden>
7. The final answer should always be preceded by this level 3 markdown heading : "After an in-depth reflection..." and contain at least 5 paragraphs

/*

mirostat	Enable Mirostat sampling for controlling perplexity. (default: 0, 0 = disabled, 1 = Mirostat, 2 = Mirostat 2.0)	int	mirostat 0
mirostat_eta	Influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text. A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive. (Default: 0.1)	float	mirostat_eta 0.1
mirostat_tau	Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output. A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text. (Default: 5.0)	float	mirostat_tau 5.0
num_ctx	Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token. (Default: 2048)	int	num_ctx 4096
repeat_last_n	Sets how far back for the model to look back to prevent repetition. (Default: 64, 0 = disabled, -1 = num_ctx)	int	repeat_last_n 64
repeat_penalty	Sets how strongly to penalize repetitions. A higher value (e.g., 1.5) will penalize repetitions more strongly, while a lower value (e.g., 0.9) will be more lenient. (Default: 1.1)	float	repeat_penalty 1.1
temperature	The temperature of the model. Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively. (Default: 0.8)	float	temperature 0.7
seed	Sets the random number seed to use for generation. Setting this to a specific number will make the model generate the same text for the same prompt. (Default: 0)	int	seed 42
stop	Sets the stop sequences to use. When this pattern is encountered the LLM will stop generating text and return. Multiple stop patterns may be set by specifying multiple separate stop parameters in a modelfile.	string	stop ["AI assistant:"]
tfs_z	Tail free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output. A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more, while a value of 1.0 disables this setting. (default: 1)	float	tfs_z 1
num_predict	Maximum number of tokens to predict when generating text. (Default: 128, -1 = infinite generation, -2 = fill context)	int	num_predict 42
top_k	Reduces the probability of generating nonsense. A higher value (e.g. 100) will give more diverse answers, while a lower value (e.g. 10) will be more conservative. (Default: 40)	int	top_k 40
top_p	Works together with top-k. A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text. (Default: 0.9)	float	top_p 0.9
